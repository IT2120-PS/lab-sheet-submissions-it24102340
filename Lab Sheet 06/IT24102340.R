#Binomial Distribution
#Here, random variable X has binomial distribution with n=50 and p=0.85

#i
dbinom(46,50,0.85)

#2
#i.
# X = number of calls received in one hour

#ii. 
#Because calls arrive on average 12 per hour and are (assumed) independent, X ~ Poisson (Î»=12).

#iii
dpois(15,12)
